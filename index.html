<p>This space will contain information on the process, principles and <strong><a href="https://benmolineaux.github.io/bookshelf/">source texts</a></strong> involved in generating a linguistically tagged corpus of the earliest writings in Mapudungun, spanning 1606 to 1936. </p>
<p> A Corpus of Historical Mapudungun is the main proposed outcome of a <a href="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/grant-schemes/early-career-fellowships">Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship</a> awarded to <a href="http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/bmolinea/">Benjamin Molineaux</a> at the University of Edinburgh's <a href="http://www.amc.lel.ed.ac.uk/">Angus McIntosh Centre for Historical Linguistics</a> and due to run between April 2018 and March 2021.</p>

<p>Mapudungun is the ancestral language of the Mapuche people of south-central Chile and Argentina.  Today Mapudungun is spoken mostly in pockets of Chile's 8th, 9th, 10th and 14th regions by an estimated 200,000 speakers. In Argentina, numbers of self-reportedly competent speakers are around 8,400.  In both countries, monolingualism is vanishingly rare, with the range of interlocutors and topics for the use of the language having grown progressively smaller. </p>
<p>The genetic affiliation of Mapudungun is uncertain. A number of claims have been made, ranging from relation to near-neighbours to the north – such as Quechua, Aymara and Pano-Tacanan – and to the south – Kawésqar, Yaghan and Chon (Tierra del Fuego, now extinct) – as well as membership in more distant families such as Arawakan, Mayan, or Aztec and Uto-Aztecan.  With strong evidence lacking for any of these theories, the language is often presumed to be an isolate.  From a regional-typological perspective, however, it can be grouped with other Andean-type languages with agglutinating, strictly ordered morphology, with a special affinity towards Quechua and Aymara, as far as the tendency for suffixation goes.</p>
<p>Mapudungun is considered a polysynthetic, agglutinating, head-marking language. Insofar as these categories can be considered useful, their fundamental locus of instantiation in the language is the verb, which displays – aside from intricate (obligatory and optional) inflectional morphology – a wide array of derivational and compounding processes. This richness of verbal morphology is in stark contrast with the noun, where, barring compounding (which is highly productive), morphological structure is markedly sparse, displaying no gender and practically no case or obligatory number marking.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Historical Record of Mapudungun</h3>

<p>The first formal description of the language, by Jesuit Luis de Valdivia, was published in 1606 and held that ‘no other language than this runs down from the city of Coquimbo and its surroundings to the island of Chiloé and beyond, and from the foot of the great snow-covered mountain-range to the sea’(`To the reader'). In the same text, Mapudungun is claimed to be mostly homogenous, with some regional variation in vocabulary, though ‘the precepts and rules of this art are general for all the provinces’. Whether or not Valdivia’s assessment was correct, the past 410 years have seen drastic changes both in the language’s geographic distribution and range of use. The CHM aims to describe the variation within the historical record by transcribing and coding a large proportion of the written record for the language. Most of the earliest material comes from Christian missionaries, though there are also texts from explorers and military men, as well as, later on, a few texts with more explicitly academic and cultural aims.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Source Texts</h3>
 <h4> <a href="https://benmolineaux.github.io/bookshelf/"> The Source Material for the CHM </a> </h4> <p>Currently contains a list of relevant documents representing data for historical Mapudungun (1606-1936). It will eventually contain brief descriptions (metadata) for the texts, as well as links to the image-based PDF files. Once Optical Character Recognition (OCR) methods have been fine-tuned for Mapudungun, plain-text transcriptions of the materials will be matched with the PDFs. </p>
        
       <p> The careful transcription and tagging of the historical material that is proposed for this projects follows a long tradition at the Angus McIntosh Centre, working mostly on early English and Scots. The importance of these methods, however were not lost to some of the more prominent Mapudungun scholars, as evidenced in the following passage by Dr. Rudolf Lenz, who conducted some of the earliest explicitly academic studies of the language </p>
        <blockquote> Aun el lenguaje vulgar que no tiene ninguna lengua literaria al lado puede ser una cosa mucho ménos determinada de lo que comunmente se cree, i no siempre podrá justificarse que en la edicion filolójica de un testo de siglos pasados se uniforme la ortografia del autor en todos los casos. Cuando la ortografía vacila en lenguas que se escriben poco, esto puede espresar el empleo de diferentes pronunciaciones en una misma palabra, o puede tener la causa de que ninguna de las diferentes maneras de escribir corresponda bien a la pronunciacion. Mucho mas raro será que el autor se haya simplemente equivocada al escribir lo que pronunciaba.
        </blockquote>
