<p>This page will contain a series of pdf documents representing data for historical Mapudungun (1606-1936).  These will be listed with brief descriptions (metadata) and will eventually be matched with plain text versions of the relevant parts of the texts.</p>

<p>Mapudungun  is the ancestral language of the Mapuche people of south-central Chile and Argentina.  Today Mapudungun is spoken mostly in pockets of Chile's 8th, 9th, 10th and 14th regions by an estimated 144,000 speakers. In Argentina, numbers of self-reportedly competent speakers are around 8,400.  In both countries, monolingualism is nearly extinct, with the range of interlocutors and topics for the use of the language having grown progressively smaller, and the majority of speakers being elderly and living in traditional, rural communities. Transmission to new generations is also heavily compromised, with rural speakers addressing children in the language in no more than 8.2\% of cases, while in urban settings a mere 0.8\% of speakers tend to do so. </p>
<p>The genetic affiliation of Mapudungun is uncertain. A number of claims have been made, ranging from relation to near-neighbours to the north – such as Quechua, Aymara and Pano-Tacanan – and to the south – Kawésqar, Yaghan and Chon (Tierra del Fuego, now extinct) – as well as membership in more distant families such as Arawakan, Mayan, or Aztec and Uto-Aztecan.  With strong evidence lacking for any of these theories, the language is often presumed to be an isolate.  From a regional-typological perspective, however, it can be grouped with other Andean-type languages with agglutinating, strictly ordered morphology, with a special affinity towards Quechua and Aymara, as far as the tendency for suffixation goes.</p>

<p>The first formal description of the language, by Jesuit Luis de Valdivia, was published in 1606 and held that ‘no other language than this runs down from the city of Coquimbo and its surroundings to the island of Chiloé and beyond, and from the foot of the great snow-covered mountain-range to the sea’ \citep[`To the reader']{Valdivia}. In the same text, Mapudungun is claimed to be mostly homogenous, with some regional variation in vocabulary, though ‘the precepts and rules of this art are general for all the provinces’. Whether or not Valdivia’s assessment was correct, the past 410 years have seen drastic changes both in the language’s geographic distribution and range of use.</p>
